      <description>Bit Set Go is a reversing challenge that was part of the 2022 Jade CTF. We were given a binary and its output, and had to find the flag.
Overview output consists of 41 seemingly random bytes:
0206541B 175B135B 17375C17 0C3A5C11 37510409 15125C16 370B5811 370D550F 1E2E312B 000C0402 37 bitsetgo is a 64-bit ELF go binary containing debug symbols. By running it, we see that it reads the two files flag.txt and key.</description>
